Temporary Employment Corporation
During peak periods, Temporary Employment Corporation (TEC) places temporary workers in companies.
TEC’s manager gives you the following description of the business:
•	TEC has a file of candidates who are willing to work.
•	If the candidate has worked before, that candidate has a specific job history. (Naturally, no job history exists if the candidate has never worked.) Each time the candidate works, one additional job history record is created.
•	Each candidate has earned several qualifications. Each qualification may be earned by more than one candidate. (For example, it is possible for more than one candidate to have earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree or a Microsoft Network Certification. And clearly, a candidate may have earned both a BBA and a Microsoft Network Certification.)
•	TEC offers courses to help candidates improve their qualifications.
•	Every course develops one specific qualification; however, TEC does not offer a course for every qualification. Some qualifications have multiple courses that develop that qualification.
•	Some courses cover advanced topics that require specific qualifications as prerequisites. Some courses cover basic topics that do not require any prerequisite qualifications. A course can have several prerequisites. A qualification can be a prerequisite for more than one course.
•	Courses are taught during training sessions. A training session is the presentation of a single course. Over time, TEC will offer many training sessions for each course; however, new courses may not have any training sessions scheduled right away.
•	Candidates can pay a fee to attend a training session. A training session can accommodate several candidates, although new training sessions will not have any candidates registered at first.
•	TEC also has a list of companies that request temporaries.
•	Each time a company requests a temporary employee, TEC makes an entry in the Openings folder. That folder contains an opening number, a company name, required qualifications, a starting date, an anticipated ending date, and hourly pay.
•	Each opening requires only one specific or main qualification.
•	When a candidate matches the qualification, the job is assigned, and an entry is made in the Placement Record folder. That folder contains an opening number, a candidate number, the total hours worked, etc. In addition, an entry is made in the job history for the candidate.
•	An opening can be filled by many candidates, and a candidate can fill many openings.
•	TEC uses special codes to describe a candidate’s qualifications for an opening. The list of codes is shown in the table.
